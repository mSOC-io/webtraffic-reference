**\x16\x03\x01**
The string "\x16\x03\x01" is a representation of binary data in hexadecimal format and is commonly associated with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It is often seen in logs related to web servers and security incidents.
The string "\x16\x03\x01" is just the start of a TLS 1.0 handshake, i.e. content type (0x16 = handshake) followed by TLS version.
The presence of this string in web server logs may indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the TLS protocol or to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
